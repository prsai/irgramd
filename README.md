# irgramd - IRC <-> Telegram Gateway

irgramd is a gateway that allows connecting from an [IRC] client to
[Telegram] as a regular user (not bot)

irgramd is written in [python] (version 3), it acts as an IRC server
where an IRC client can connect and on the other side it's a Telegram client
using the [Telethon] library
